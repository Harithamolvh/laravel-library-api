## üì¶ Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Harithamolvh/laravel-library-api.git](https://github.com/Harithamolvh/laravel-library-api.git)
    cd laravel-library-api

    *Note: The repository name in the clone URL is `laravel-library-api`, but the directory you are changing into is `library-app`. I will correct the `cd` command to match the repository name.*
